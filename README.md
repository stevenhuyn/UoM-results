# Unimelb Results Checker

Periodically checks my.unimelb results page for new results and sends an email when new results are posted.

## Dependencies

Requires python modules [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [html5lib](https://github.com/html5lib/), and [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/). You can install these dependencies with [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) using `pip install -r path/to/repo/requirements.txt`.

## Usage

The results-checking script needs two files to be placed within the **results** directory: **login.txt** and **email.txt**. **login.txt** should contain your student username on the first line, followed by your student password on the second line. An example **login.txt** file would be:

```
farrugiam
un1melBpAS5w0rd!1
```

**email.txt** uses the same structure, but should contain the gmail username of the account you want to use to email the results, and its gmail password on the second line. An example **email.txt** file for the gmail address `results.robot@gmail.com` would be:

```
results.robot
em@ilpAS5w0rd!1
```

> Note: only the part of the email address before the `@gmail.com` is included in the file.

After these files have been added to the **results** directory, you should be able to run the script from within that directory with `python main.py`. If the WAM on your results page is different from the number in **results/wam.txt**, you'll receive an email at `username@student.unimelb.edu.au` where `username` is the name in the first line of **results/login.txt**.
